                Your organisation will need to take some time to write a good briefing, and have

                questions will be asked via email.

            <div className="c-faq__item__answer">
              <p>
                <strong>Before</strong> open summer of code, it&apos;s important to create a good
                briefing with what you expect of your team. The better the briefing, the less
                questions will pop up, the better the project.
              </p>
              <p>
                In the briefing you will outline what kind of project your organisation envisions
                and what features and functions your end-product shall contain. Based on your
                layout, osoc mobilises the student profiles required to make this vision come to
                life.
              </p>
              <p>
                In case you have a very defined project, a prioritized list of features will help
                the students to define and create something valueable for you. But, if you want the
                students to experiment, provide a good vision and mission to the students so
                they&apos;ll have a good sense of direction.

            <div className="c-faq__item__answer">
              <p>
                At the beginning of osoc, a representative of your organisation will present your
                organisation and project briefing to the students. From then on you will meet your
                team once a week to receive pitched progress updates and give feedback.
              </p>
              <p>
                In those feedback sessions you&apos;ll provide feedback to make sure the students
                are going in the right direction (on development, design, product management, ...).
              </p>
              <p>
                Preferrably, we have a single point of contact that can make the decisions that need
                to be made during the development of the project. This person will brief the
                students at the beginning of the project, and will provide feedback in July.

                Through the diverse set of participants&apos; skills and expertise at open Summer of
                code, you can co-create an innovative digital solution for the challenges your
                organisation faces. All while fostering the individual social impact of engaging a
                diverse and talented group of students in a digital transformative project as well
                as a broader societal impact of training a new generation on the importance of open
                data use and open source coding in a sustainable way that simultaneously generates
                economic value.
